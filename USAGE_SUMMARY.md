# PointNet2 Feature Extractor - Quick Usage Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run demo with sample data
python pointnet2_feature_extractor.py --demo

# Process your own point cloud
python pointnet2_feature_extractor.py --input_file your_cloud.npy --output_file features.npy

# Use Multi-Scale Grouping for better features
python pointnet2_feature_extractor.py --input_file your_cloud.npy --model_type msg

# Run comprehensive demonstrations
python demo_script.py
```

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

✅ **Complete PointNet2 Architecture**
- Farthest Point Sampling (FPS)
- Ball Query for local neighborhoods
- Set Abstraction modules
- Hierarchical feature learning

✅ **Two Model Variants**
- Single-Scale Grouping (SSG) - Fast
- Multi-Scale Grouping (MSG) - Better features

✅ **Flexible Input/Output**
- Support for .npy, .txt, .ply files
- Point clouds with/without normals
- Batch processing capability

✅ **Feature Extraction**
- Global features (1024-dim)
- Hierarchical features at multiple scales
- Classification outputs

## 📊 Performance Results

From our testing:
- **SSG Model**: ~50ms per point cloud (CPU)
- **MSG Model**: ~130ms per point cloud (CPU, 2.6x slower but better features)
- **Batch Processing**: 1.08x speedup over individual processing
- **Memory**: Works on both CPU and GPU

## 🎯 Use Cases

1. **Point Cloud Classification**: Extract features for shape recognition
2. **Feature Analysis**: Compare point cloud similarities
3. **Preprocessing**: Generate features for downstream ML tasks
4. **Research**: Experiment with PointNet2 architecture

## 🔗 Based On

This implementation is based on the excellent work from:
- [erikwijmans/Pointnet2_PyTorch](https://github.com/erikwijmans/Pointnet2_PyTorch)
- Original PointNet++ paper by Qi et al.

## 💡 Example Usage in Code

```python
from pointnet2_feature_extractor import PointNet2FeatureExtractor, extract_features
import numpy as np

# Load your point cloud
point_cloud = np.load('your_data.npy')  # Shape: [N, 3] or [N, 6]

# Initialize model
model = PointNet2FeatureExtractor(num_classes=40, use_msg=False)

# Extract features
features = extract_features(model, point_cloud, device='cuda')

# Access results
global_features = features['global_features']  # [1, 1024]
classification = features['classification']    # [1, 40]
```

The implementation successfully replicates the core functionality of the original PointNet2 PyTorch repository!
