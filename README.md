# See-Through

This project focuses on an **Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)** working specifically with **mmWave radars**.

---

## Problem

Single radar-based systems in autonomous vehicles have a **narrow field of view**, limiting situational awareness.

---

## Solution

**Fusion of multiple radars** to enhance the field of view and provide a safer driving experience.

In this project, I work with **point cloud data from mmWave radars** to detect and track various objects on the road. By applying fusion techniques, I aim to improve environment understanding and significantly widen the radar coverage.

---

## Why mmWave Radars?

- Excellent at measuring **velocity** and **angle** of objects.
- Robust performance in adverse weather conditions such as **fog, rain, and dust**.
- Provide reliable data for **object detection and tracking**.

## Dataset

For this internship project, I chose to work with the **RadarScenes Dataset** because it contains **2D point clouds with velocity and RCS information** and is already labeled.

You can find and download the dataset here:

## Proposed Workflow & Models

Below is the proposed workflow and the models I plan to explore, based on reviewing multiple research papers and comparing results:

## Current Status

The research is ongoing, and I may adjust the choice of models after conducting further experiments.
